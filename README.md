# AIExpert-APP-llm-with-specialization-in-AI

The AI Alpha model was created from moondream llm.


# Introduction

This application leverages the power of Ollama, a framework for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs), to provide you with a user-friendly interface for generating text using the "aiAlpha" model. This model is assumed to be already set up and running locally on your machine at port 11434.

# Prerequisites

Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Streamlit (https://streamlit.io/)
Langchain (https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
Ollama ([invalid URL removed]) with the "aiAlpha" model installed and running locally on port 11434 (specific instructions may vary depending on your setup)
Installation

# Install the required libraries using pip:

Bash
pip install streamlit langchain
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Follow Ollama's installation guide ([[invalid URL removed](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)]) to set up the "aiAlpha" model and ensure it's running on port 11434.

# Running the Application

Save the code snippet as a Python file (e.g., ollama_expert.py).

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the saved file.

Run the application using:

Bash
streamlit run ollama_expert.py
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Using the Application

A web interface will launch in your default browser, displaying the title "Ollama AI Expert" and the subheader "Using the AI Alpha Model".
Enter your question or prompt in the text input field labeled "Enter your question:".
Click the button labeled "Generate".
Expected Behavior

If you enter a valid prompt and click "Generate", the application will communicate with the local Ollama instance and generate a response using the "aiAlpha" model.
The response will be displayed below a heading "Response:" formatted in a success message.
If you click "Generate" without entering a prompt, an error message stating "Please enter a prompt!" will be displayed.
Troubleshooting

Error: "Ollama model not found" or "Connection refused."
Ensure Ollama is set up correctly and running on port 11434 locally. Check installation guides or community resources for assistance.
Error: "ImportError: cannot import name 'Ollama'"
Verify that Langchain is installed (pip install langchain).
Limited Functionality:
Ollama models can have varying capabilities. If the generated responses are not satisfactory, consider exploring other Ollama models or experimenting with prompt crafting techniques for better results.
Next Steps

Explore the capabilities of Ollama and the "aiAlpha" model by crafting different prompts and observing the generated responses.
Consider customizing the application to include additional features, such as saving prompts, fine-tuning the model, or integrating with other APIs.
Disclaimer

The reliability and accuracy of the generated text depend on the quality of the "aiAlpha" model and the prompts provided.
Be mindful of potential biases or limitations inherent in any LLM model.

# Additional Notes

The code assumes a basic understanding of Python and web development concepts.
Security considerations: For production use, ensure proper security measures are implemented when running Ollama and accessing the application interface.
It creates a text input box for users to enter their prompt.
A button labeled "Generate" is displayed.
Clicking the button triggers an if statement:
If the prompt text is not empty:
The generate_text function is called with the prompt text.
The application displays a header "Response:" and the generated response using a success message box.
If the prompt text is empty:
An error message is displayed asking the user to enter a prompt.
Running the application
Ensure you have Ollama set up and running locally with the desired model ("aiAlpha").
Save the code as a Python file (e.g., ollama_app.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the application using streamlit run ollama_app.py.
This will launch the Streamlit application in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.
Using the application
Enter your question or prompt in the text box.
Click the "Generate" button.
If a valid prompt is provided, the application will display the response generated by the Ollama model.
